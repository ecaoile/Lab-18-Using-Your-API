## Getting Started
The following is required to run the program.
1. Visual Studio 2017 
2. The .NET desktop development workload enabled
3. ASP.NET MVC packages

## Happy path
- start the API within Visual Studio by pressing the green play button
- open Postman and enter the localhost URL along with /api/todoitem
- view all of the todo items
- perform CRUD operations on the todo items
- change the URL after the home localhost URL to /api/todolist
- view all of the todo lists
- perform CRUD operations on the todo lists
- smile
